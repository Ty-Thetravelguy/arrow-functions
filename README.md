# Role Playing Game | Dragon Repeller

In this practice project, I'll learnt fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. I'll learnt how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more in a more real life scenario.

I completed the course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and pasted all the code into VS Code.
